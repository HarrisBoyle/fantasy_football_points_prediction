#### Background

Football, with its global following of an estimated 3.5 billion fans, has seen the English Premier League (EPL) emerge as one of the most popular and competitive leagues worldwide. The EPL Fantasy Football platform, with its growing user base of 11 million players, offers a unique challenge of predicting player performances using data-driven strategies. This project aims to tackle this challenge head-on, employing a variety of machine learning techniques.
